# ZK for Artists

---

## Slide 0: Use Cases of ZK

Prove you know something without revealing it: voting, identity, ownership, compliance.

---

## Slide 1: What is ZK?

Math that creates proofs you can verify without seeing the original data.

---

## Slide 2: Succinctness

Small proof, fast verification—even for massive computations.

---

## Slide 3: Confidentiality

Prove facts while keeping the underlying data completely secret.

---

## Slide 4: Leading zkVMs

SP1, RISC Zero, Jolt, zkWASM—write normal code, get ZK proofs.

---

## Slide 5: zkVM Trade-off

You get succinctness (small proofs) but NOT automatic confidentiality—data is public by default.
